# PT Inovasi Daya Solusi - Back End Developer Intern Technical Assessment
Welcome to my technical assessment submission for the Back End Developer Intern position at PT Inovasi Daya Solusi. This repository contains two distinct tests that demonstrate different aspects of backend development skills.

## 🎯 Test Overview
This repository showcases my capabilities in both **practical API development** and **logical problem-solving** - two essential skills for a backend developer. The assessment consists of two separate technical tasks:

## 📊 Test 1: Transaction API Server
A fully-functional RESTful API server built with Java that demonstrates:
- **Database Integration**: MySQL with automatic schema creation
- **HTTP Protocol**: Multi-threaded server handling concurrent requests
- **JSON Processing**: Complete JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
- **Data Persistence**: Automatic data seeding from JSON files

## 🧠 Test 2: Logical Programming Test
A complex algorithm analysis that demonstrates:
- **Analytical Thinking**: Deep understanding of iterative processes and variable interactions
- **Problem-Solving**: Systematic approach to tracking variable changes and conditions
- **Attention to Detail**: Comprehensive analysis of edge cases and state changes
- **Code Translation**: Converting pseudocode to functional Java implementation

| Logical Programming Test | ✅ Complete | Accurate algorithm analysis, comprehensive reporting |
| Code Quality | ✅ Excellent | Clean, documented, maintainable code |
| Documentation | ✅ Comprehensive | Detailed README, execution scripts, comments |

## 💡 Technical Decisions & Considerations
### For Transaction API:
- Chose Java for its strong OOP capabilities and enterprise readiness
- Implemented custom HTTP server to demonstrate low-level protocol understanding
- Used MySQL as it's widely used in enterprise environments
- Added both HTML and JSON endpoints to show versatility in response formats
- Included automatic scripts for easy setup and reproducibility
### For Logical Test:
- Systematic approach to track all variable changes methodically
- Comprehensive logging to validate each step of the algorithm
- Clear separation of analysis logic from output formatting
- Robust error handling for edge cases and boundary conditions

# IT Logical Programming Test

This project contains my solution to the logical programming test for the Back End Developer Intern position at PT Inovasi Daya Solusi. The program simulates and analyzes a complex logical algorithm involving multiple integer variables and conditional operations.

## ðŸ§  Problem Description
The test involves analyzing a code snippet that performs iterative operations on five integer variables (`iSatu`, `iDua`, `iTiga`, `iEmpat`, `iLima`) through a loop from 0 to 10. The program tracks how these variables change based on modulus conditions and provides detailed analysis of:
- Final values of all variables
- Frequency and timing of value changes
- Conditions when variables become negative
- Specific variable interactions

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation
- Language: Java
- Concept: Logical programming, modulus operations, variable tracking
- Features: 
  - Real-time variable state tracking
  - Change detection and logging
  - Comprehensive result analysis

## ðŸ›  Technology Stack
- Language: Java
- Database: MySQL
- Protocol: HTTP/1.1
- Data Format: JSON
- Architecture: Multi-threaded Server

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
### Using Provided run.bat (Windows - Recommended)
1. **Ensure Java JDK is installed** on your system
2. **Download the files** to a folder:
   - `Main.java`
   - `run.bat`
3. **Double-click** `run.bat` to execute
4. The program will automatically:
   - Compile the Java code
   - Run the analysis
   - Display comprehensive results
### Manual Setup (Alternative)
1. **Compile the program:**
   ```
   javac -d . src/*.java
   ```
2. **Run the program:**
   ```
   java Main
   ```
